# ProductSearch

Project created for Software Engineering class in a team of three.

The purpose of this project was to find 3 best options for requested products under  15 seconds. The cheaper the product is the better the deal is.

We used Java EE framework to connect website (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) with our code, where web crawler is. We designed web crawler to search products on 'SkÄ…piec.pl'.
Then we implemented some algorithms to make operations on the results. Finally, the results are printed on the website. Do not worry if sometimes the search takes more than 15 seconds.

To run this program You need to add Apache Tomcat as a server to the project and executable file is 'WebCrawler.java'
